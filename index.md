## Welcome to My Website!

I am a hobbiest gamedev whi makes small game with the Godot Game engine.

You can check out my games on my [itch.io page](https://spookyhousegames.itch.io/).

In the future I hope to create more games and maybe even expand this webpage to have more tutorials and devlogs!

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/spookyhousegames/spookyhousegames.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
